High resolution, very precisely epipolar aligned pairs of images of
a "Wizard of Oz" tea pot.  

Matlab calibration params are in rect_info_*.mat files

This should be a "do-able" challenge, made somewhat difficult by 
secularities.  There are enough views to do a 3D reconstruction.

Ground truth to follow.
